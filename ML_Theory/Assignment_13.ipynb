    "Posterior -  historical data suggests that around 60% of students who start college will graduate within 6 years. This is the prior probability. However, you think that figure is actually much lower, so set out to collect new data. The evidence you collect suggests that the true figure is actually closer to 50%; This is the posterior probability."
